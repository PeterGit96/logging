# Exercise - Spring Boot - logging
* write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that:
  * has two custom int environment variables with the values `2` and `8`
  * starts from `INFO` for root level logging
  * starts from `DEBUG` for services level logging
  * the logging info has ANSI colours enabled
  * has a basic controller that has 3 mappings:
    * `/`: returns just a welcome message and logs it
    * `/exp`: returns a service that: 
      * takes the 2 numeric env values, then logs and returns the power (exponent) of the 2 values
      * logs when starting and when finishing the calculation
    * `/get-errors`: throws a new custom error that will be logged
  * saves all the logs in a subfolder called `myCustomLogs`
